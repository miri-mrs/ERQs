Quasar Physics with the JWST and MIRI MRS
###################

Abstract::
  
Our Directors Discretionary time for an Early Release Science (DD-ERS) program will help the community learn about the longest wavelength spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS). We will release a suite of science-enabling products (SEPs) via a public data analysis and code repository that we have already begun to build: github.com/miri-mrs. The accompanying documentation is also already being written: miri-mrs.readthedocs.io. Our primary SEP goal is to produce a Python package that quickly manipulates and analyzes the full MRS Level 3 data, in particular the MRS Spectral Cubes and 1D spectra.

To do this we will observe a set of mid-infrared bright quasars at the peak of cosmological quasar activity, z~2.5. Their global star-formation properties are currently unknown, but spectroscopy with JWST MIRI MRS will quantify the level of star-formation in these objects. These observations will address a major and still open extragalactic astrophysical question: what are the star-formation properties of mid-infrared luminous quasars at the peak of quasar activity? Moreover, the IFU aspect of the MRS will enable investigations of unprecedented detail of both the central AGN IR emission and any potentially extended emission. This novel observation has the capacity to link sites of star-formation to AGN activity and provide direct observational evidence for AGN feedback at high-z and high luminosities.

Our NoI was #87. This proposal, and the accompanying code, calculations and documentation can be found at: github.com/d80b2t.
