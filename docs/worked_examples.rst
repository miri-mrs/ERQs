Extremely Red Quasars
========================

Extremely Red Quasars (ERQs) are a unique obscured quasar population
with extreme phys- ical conditions related to powerful outflows across
the line-forming regions. These sources are the signposts of the most
extreme form of quasar feedback at the peak epoch of galaxy formation,
and may represent an active “blow-out” phase of quasar evolution.

The ability for the MRS to obtain integral field unit spectroscopy
allows us to investigate the spatial information associated with the
high IR fluxes in the ERQs. The spatial distribution of the IR will
give direct clues to the power source of the IR emission. The IFU
aspect of the Medium Resolution Spectrometer will allow investigations
in unprecedented detail of both the central AGN IR emission and any
potentially extended emission in z~2.5 quasars. As a null hypothesis,
we suggest that weak PAH emission will be in the nuclear regions and
strong(er) PAH emission in the extended source. However, very recent
studies with H-alpha of z~2 quasars suggest that narrow H-alpha
emission might be from a spatially unresolved source.

In this Worked Example, we will example the nature of the ERQs using
JWST MIRI MRS IFU data.
