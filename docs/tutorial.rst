Tutorial for JWST MIRI MRS
==================================

We will be using MIRISim.

MIRISim is a simulator package designed to simulate photon propagation
through MIRI. It has been written in python and delivers detector
images consistent with the expected on orbit performance. The outputs
of MIRISim are consistent with the MIRI sensitivity model, and return
the same uncalibrated data format that will be made available to JWST
observers. All relevant metadata are included to be able to ingest the
outputs of MIRISim into the JWST calibration pipeline being developed
by STScI.

MIRISim was developed by Pamela Klaassen (UK ATC) on behalf of the
MIRISim team, Part of the MIRI European Consortium
