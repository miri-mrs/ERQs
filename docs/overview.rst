Overview
========================

These pages are ccmmunity documentation for the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium-resolution
spectrometer (MRS).

The original motication is from the Early Release Science:
``Documentation to ensure open access to representative datasets in
support of the preparation of Cycle 2 proposals, and engage a broad
cross-section of the astronomical community in familiarizing
themselves with MIRI MRS data and scientific capabilities.''

However, the hope and goal is for this to be a major resource for the
fully stacked and developed MIRI MRS science analysis codes.
